116403	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] worries about potential instability.
116404	An enraged [NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] withdraws his support for the project.
116405	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is alive, but shaken.
117301	Project stage 1 completed
117302	First channel laid out

117304	Project stage 2 completed
117305	Second channel laid out

114738	"Before we start constructing our first channel, you'll have to examine a few cracks in the ice plain. It won't do to set up the site and find out the layer is impassable."
114739	"Dr. Young's concerns are exaggerated. Let's not get distracted. Construction of the Icebreakers requires a stable supply of materials."
114740	"I'm pleased to report the teams are ready to be brought to the site. They are eager to get this project off the ground. It will bring life to this desolate place."
114741	"You'd think all Custodians would appreciate the economic growth this project brings. Make sure there are enough helping hands."
114742	"I've received reports of fractures in the ice. We'll need to construct a mesh that will stop ice floes from breaking off into the channel. Would you deliver the materials?"
114743	"We have no choice but to detonate an iceberg for our second channel or the ice will be impassable. I'm sending the coordinates."
114744	"Fair enough. Losing the Custodian's support is certainly a setback at such a critical point. But still. Make sure our icebreakers' energy supply is taken care of."
114746	"Respond immediately! A ship has been sunk by a stray floe at the third channel site. The survivors barely made it into the lifeboats, we don't... we don't know how many didn't make it."
114747	"Do you have enough Stimulants? The survivors need strength! I knew the endeavour was risky, but I thought it was worth it. But how can sacrificing lives be worth it?"
114748	"I was too hasty... I should never have forced the shortest way through. No more risks. Make sure the icebreakers are equipped with diamond coating."
117748	"Before we start constructing our first channel, you'll have to examine a few cracks in the ice plain. We want to rule out the layer is impassable."
117749	"Dr. Young's concerns are exaggerated. Let's not get distracted, we need enough scientists to finalize our calculations and prepare teams."
117750	"I'm pleased to report the teams are ready to be brought to the site. They are eager to get this project off the ground, it will bring life to this desolate place."
117751	"A stable energy supply is tricky to establish here. Make sure it doesn't fluctuate during our final calibrations. Oh, didn't I mention we'd be using explosives?"
117752	"Now move the team to a safe distance. And don't worry about the Custodians, this procedure adheres to the strictest of regulations. I will assuage them."
117753	"Fast and effective, my favorite work ethics. The honor of pushing the button is all yours."
117754	"We've been warned about the next location. We've also been warned to secure the protected wildlife. Let's show our goodwill."
117755	"We cannot proceed with stationary explosives, the terrain is too hard to navigate. But why not use what we already have, such as mobile firepower."
117756	"Fair enough. The Custodian's support has been lip service anyhow. Our plan's next step is the construction of a high-pressure ice drill."
117757	"This drill will break through the plain and provide pockets to place the proper detonators. Of course it has to be operated by capable hands."
117758	"The ice is a lot sturdier than expected. Well, perseverance is what separates the wheat from the chaff. Fuel the drill and we'll be through in no time."
117759	"The explosive charges have been placed, but the team still is on site. The evacuation radius is a vague number, but I'm sure all will be well."
117760	"Your work has been outstanding, I'm looking forward to this project's future. And now to the main attraction."
117761	"Respond immediately! An icebreaker sunk trying to break open a channel! The survivors barely made it onto lifeboats, we... we don't know how many didn't."
117762	"We need to bring them to someplace warm! I knew this method was risky, but I thought it was worth it. But how can sacrificing lives be worth it?"
117763	"I was too hasty... I should never have forced the shortest way through. Retrieve the icebreaker parts or the site won't be safe to approach."
117764	"I'm done with risks. I've personally ordered the development of a method that can be easily controlled. And our brightest minds will build it."
117765	"No more brute force. We'll be melting the explosives into the ice. The placement has been calculated thoroughly. Please escort the team to place them."
117766	"Of course it's operation won't come without a high demand in energy. But there'll be no excess heat - only efficient heat."
117768	"The team is finished setting up. They should be brought to a safe distance for an operation of this size. My company will be retrieving the waste later."
117770	"The perimeter has been secured. Just say the word. Or press the button, so to say."
109045	"I expected to see you here. Let me explain my case: Saayman International hopes to expand the arctic's food supply network, in partnership with you."
115263	Reach a Corporation Level of 12 to continue the ice-breaking process.
115264	Reach a Corporation Level of 24 to continue the ice-breaking process.
114922	"These channels are a beacon for trade in the arctic. It's my duty to make certain they stay safe. You helped us in our hour of need, I will not forget that."
120054	Break through a floating glacial sheet to create a new transport route.
114838	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] holds out for more refugees to arive.
114839	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is grateful you helped so many people stay alive, promissing to spread the word.
114840	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is grateful you gave the refugees a safe home and a new perspective.

117863	In her desperation, [NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] tells you she and her charges are being hunted by the Orbital Watch.
117864	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] informs you just how life-threatening the situation on former LEC territory is.
117865	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] has no other choice than to ask you to accept refugees in your settlement.

117867	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is expecting more refugees sometime soon.
117868	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] promises the refugees will help out where they can.
120367	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] voices his intent to oppose the refugee camp.
120368	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is enraged, that Virgil Drake has placed landmines all around the camp.
120371	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] thanks you for taking him to the camp.
120369	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is happy to receive new refugees...
120375	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is beside herself, as Orbital Watch spies have poisoned the supplies.

114749	"As pessoas estão fugindo em qualquer veículo que possam encontrar. Muitos estão se movendo sem rumo até que suas reservas de oxigênio se esgotem. Eu sei que alguns conseguiram alcançar este setor. Por favor, leve-os para dentro."
114750	"Enviei um sinal em todas as frequências não monitoradas. Mais refugiados virão. Mas duvido que seus veículos aguentem. Gostaria que tivéssemos transportadores para buscá-los..."
114751	"Uma das minhas espiãs do QG da Guarda Orbital arriscou o pescoço para desviar um ônibus espacial. Ela trará unidades de alojamento de refugiados para cá. Ela não pode arriscar fazer isso de novo, então temos que pegá-los agora."
114752	"Que bagunça! As unidades habitacionais não resistiram à queda... Agora não passam de um monte de lixo. Você tem peças de metal para torná-las pelo menos habitáveis?"
114753	“Colocamos os refugiados nas unidades habitacionais. Conto com vocês para o abastecimento de alimentos. Qualquer tipo de alimento nutritivo servirá”.
114754	·Que...? Que tipo de monstro poderia pedir algo assim? Virgil Drake... ele minou toda a área! Alguns refugiados já... Não, não podemos deixar algo assim acontecer de novo!"
114755	"Que bom que você abriu o caminho. Outro comboio de refugiados está se aproximando deste setor. Ele contém mais requerentes de asilo do que eu esperava. Teremos que controlar o abastecimento de alimentos."
114756	"A escória da Guarda Orbital! Eles atacaram o comboio de refugiados! Os sobreviventes vão continuar a pé. Eles não vão durar muito! Temos que pegá-los, rápido!"
114757	"Maldito Virgil Drake! Esse homem é o diabo desfardado! Um novo comboio de refugiados acabou de chegar. As pessoas dizem que os bandidos de Drake os caçaram como animais! Mas não podemos levá-los para dentro!"
114758	"Eu deveria ter cheirado aqueles ratos! Havia agentes da Guarda Orbital entre os recém-chegados! Eles colocaram patógenos altamente contagiosos em nossos tanques de água! Precisamos de pessoal médico agora!"
114759	"Nossos médicos fizeram um diagnóstico inicial! É o vírus COVID 2205 modificado altamente contagioso. Aposto que Drake pensou que não teríamos como obter a medicação necessária! Mas nós temos você..."
118272	"Aqueles que estão sendo perseguidos fogem em qualquer veículo que consigam embarcar. Muitos estão se movendo sem rumo até que suas reservas de oxigênio acabem. Mas alguns conseguiram."
118273	"Enviei um sinal em todas as frequências não monitoradas. Mais refugiados virão. Seus veículos não os trarão aqui. Temos de fornecer transportadores."
118274	"Um dos meus espiões de uma colônia da Guarda Orbital conseguiu desviar um ônibus espacial e soltar unidades habitacionais para os refugiados. Ele não pode arriscar fazer isso de novo, então pegue-os agora."
118275	"Que bagunça! As unidades habitacionais não resistiram à queda... Você tem peças de metal para que possamos torná-las habitáveis ​​de novo?"
118276	“Todos estão alojados em unidades habitacionais. Mas preciso contar com vocês para o abastecimento de alimentos. Qualquer tipo de alimento nutritivo servirá”.
118277	"Que pessoa horrível ele é capaz de fazer tal coisa! Virgil Drake havia minado toda a área! Alguns refugiados já... Não, não vamos deixar algo assim acontecer de novo!"
118278	"Que bom que você abriu o caminho. Há outra expedição de refugiados indo para este setor com mais pessoas do que eu havia calculado. Teremos que racionar comida."
118279	"Os reservatórios de oxigênio! Esses ratos da Guarda Orbital querem nos privar até mesmo do mais básico de nossa existência! E também não podemos racionar o ar que respiramos."
118280	"Há cada vez mais de nós, o que mostra quantas pessoas estão sofrendo as consequências das atrocidades de Drake. E isso também significa que temos mais sistemas de suporte de vida para alimentar."
118281	"Os homens do Drake se esforçam para impedir que os refugiados cheguem aqui. Agora eles estão usando sistemas de bloqueio para quebrar os veículos e deixar os refugiados morrerem lá dentro! Rápido!"
118282	"Chegou uma transmissão do novo comboio de refugiados. Dizem que os capangas de Drake os caçaram como animais! Mas podemos colocá-los em segurança!"
118283	"Eu deveria ter cheirado aqueles ratos! Havia agentes da Guarda Orbital entre os recém-chegados! Eles colocaram alguns agentes tóxicos em nossos sistemas de oxigênio! Precisamos de pessoal médico!"
118284	"Aqueles porcos estão aproveitando o caos para voltar para Drake! Temos notícias de um carro desaparecido, você ainda pode encontrá-los! E então deixe-os comigo."
118286	"Não seremos tão descuidados de novo, pelo menos eu. Drake e seus capangas não param por nada. Nosso povo precisa de seguranças treinados para protegê-los!"
118285	"Nossos médicos fizeram testes para toxinas! Um composto à base de cloro estranho e altamente reativo. Aposto que Drake pensou que não teríamos como tratá-lo. Mas nós temos você..."
109046	"Olá... Oh, finalmente... Escute, nós... Não sabemos para onde ir! Não nos obrigue a partir! Vidas estão em jogo! Vamos retribuir o favor, eu prometo."
114923	"Se não fosse por você, todas essas pessoas teriam morrido. Faremos o possível para retribuir! Prometo que todos contribuirão para ajudar."

116387	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] se dirige a você com uma proposta.
116388	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] propõe um projeto conjunto para extrair minerais de meteoros.
116389	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] acredita que os recursos meteóricos são científicos e economicamente importantes.
116390	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] aguarda a sua cooperação neste empreendimento de prestígio.
116391	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] está indisponível no momento, mas entrará em contato com você.
116392	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] está aguardando liberação e pede que você espere.
116393	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] está orgulhoso da importância do projeto de mineração.

114760	"Before we proceed to drill into the meteors, we must first determine what exactly we'll be drilling for. Could you perhaps locate some meteor samples for us?"
114761	"You know, technically they're not meteors, but meteoroids since... Oh! Pardon me. You'll have to provide housing for some meteor scientists, who'll analyze our findings."
114762	"The analysis is in! And the minerals in there will have every earth mine turning green with envy. Of course, we'll still have to break open our meteor. I'll leave that to you."
114763	"My superior commends our progress. She's confident this will prove that mining is a long-lasting business. Speaking of which, we'll need titanium to supply our miners with tools."
114764	"Cassian Industries is planning great things at the moment. It would be much appreciated if you'd take care of the delivery without me while I'm in a meeting."
114765	"Can I trust you to keep this confidential? Cassian Industries decided to pursue the idea of a second mine, but we've lost contact with our expedition team. Please, retrieve them!"
114766	"The team is suffering from radiation sickness and my superior is beside herself! If we don't have to transfer the patients, we'd be happy to recompense you for treatment."
114767	"My superior is placating the merge part- I mean, the media. But there's still the aftermath. The expedition came across radioactive waste, please clear it out."
114768	"My proposal for a minimally staffed, automatic mine has been approved! And I was appointed executive in charge. You'll help me escort the drilling equipment, won't you?"
114769	"The drill is still an experimental prototype and it's burning through our energy supply! My superior is not responding, so please help me!"
114770	"I've just received reports of the drill overheating and threatening to malfunction! What do we do now? Do you have anything that could help, anything at all?"
118292	"Before we can drill into the meteors, we'll first have to determine what exactly we'll be drilling for. Could you locate meteor samples for us?"
118293	"You know, technically they're not meteors, but meteoroids since... Oh! Pardon me. You'll have to accomodate meteoritic scientists, who'll analyze our findings."
118294	"The analysis is in! And the minerals in there will have every earth mine go green with envy. Of course, we'll still have to break open our meteor. I leave it to you."

118298	"The team is suffering from radiation sickness, my superior is beside herself! If we don't have to transfer the patients, we'd be happy to recompense you."
118299	"My superior is placating the merge part... I mean, the media. We'll have to outfit our next team with all they need to brave the radioactive conditions in there."
118300	"A well-paying job with a full coverage insurance. My superior is certain there will be a crowd of aspirants for our second team! But... you could help things along, yes?"
118301	"Weathering this scandal hasn't been easy. The press has jumped at the radioactive waste at the site. Please clear it out thoroughly."
118302	"We barely managed to fill all positions. My superior wants us to go ahead with escorting the new excavation team. I'm sure it will be fine."
118303	"My proposal was approved. A minimally staffed, automatic mine. And... I myself am fully responsible for it. I hope you're still helping me with the drilling equipment?"
118304	"This time we need a crew to remote-control the drill. The risks are much lower this way, and the job is more attractive. I do hope so, at the very least..."
118305	"I've just received reports of the drill overheating and threatening to break down! What do we do now? Do you have anything that could help, anything at all?"
118306	"The drill is still an experimental prototype and it's burning through our energy supply! My superior is not responding. Please, help me this once!"
118307	"I have a proposal. A diamond-coated drill head will reduce the power expenses substantially. I couldn't confirm this with my superior... but it will work! It has to!"
109047	"A pleasure to see you. I have a proposal for you from Cassian Industries: How do you feel about making use of the stuff stars are made of?"
114924	"For a time I feared my superior would be correct about the project being utopian. Instead, I have been given more tasks like these."
115320	Reach Corporation Level of 15 to start the second meteor exploitation.
115321	Reach Corporation Level of 30 to start the third meteor exploitation.
120056	Extract rare materials from meteor impacts on the Moon's surface.

114771	"The hotel was near completion when the owner got hit by a sudden case of accident. But the facade could use a little grandeur, don't you think? Fancy bait for golden fish."
114772	"Our future guests have extraordinary taste. Our service personnel must be able to read their every wish from their eyes... and not only that. Provide me some human resources to work with here, okay?"
114773	"We haven't even opened! And they're already flaming us about the view on the hotel rating plattforms. We better get rid of the old worker barracks at the site."
114774	"Demolishing the worker barracks wasn't enough. Now they're screaming about wanting the 'real lunar life'. Let's just cater to their romantic ideas, okay. Give them a big, authentic lunar city."
114775	"And here they are, our first visitors! Please, give them a fitting reception. And make sure our special guest gets the special treatment."
114776	"Our hotel's ratings are dropping. Our guests are complaining about the lack of unique, extreme experiences. Why not give them a show? Fire them up a little."
114777	"Give them a war and they'll perk up. The adrenaline junkies among our guests are dying to take a tour through the lunar civil war sites. Let's grant them their suicidal little wish. Just provide some bio-enhanced space suits for them."
114778	"The civil war tour is quite popular, but we should've used more reliable vehicles. Some broke down, so we had to drag them back here. All those hours trapped in a steel box. Makes our guests talkative, I'm sure."
114779	"I've planned a big anniversary event. It'll put our hotel on everyone's lips. But to handle that we are gonna have to ramp up our staff with Androids. Any extra hands and eyes are welcome."
114780	"Already made sure exclusive invitations find their way to our special guests. I've set up a menu that'll tickle their palates. Let's make sure that we have enough food to deliver it."
114781	"Check! Didn't have all that super-rare meat foodstuff on my radar. I'm not into steak and wine or whatever it's called. But only the best for our guests. Fly the stuff in."
118316	"The hotel was near completion, when the owner was struck by a sudden case of smashup. Only the facade could use a little grandiosity. Fancy bait catches golden fish."
118317	"Our future guests have extraordinary tastes. Our service staff has to read their every wishes from their eyes. Provide me some human ressources to work with here, okay?"
118318	"Without shield generators we won't get far. A few meteor hits and we can kiss this hotel goodbye. We better get to building the generators now."
118319	"We have the first bookings and the pre-orderers already cry for the 'real lunar life.' Let's cater to these romantic ideas. Give them a big, authentic lunar city."
118320	"And here they are, our first visitors! Please, give them a fitting reception. And make sure our special guest gets the special treatment."
118321	"Our hotel's ratings are dropping. The guests whine about the lack of unique, extreme experiences. Already have an idea, but we need navigation systems for that."
118322	"Now available: Tours through the lunar civil war sites! The adrenaline junkies among our guests will approve. Just provide some bio-enhanced space suits for them."
118323	"We don't have them go to actual warzones of course. Doesn't mean this never was one, though. Just demonstrate what the forgotten landmines around here are capable of."
118324	"Give them a war and the spirits rise, huh? They're almost out for blood now. And we have a substitute. Robots demolishing robots should be an a-ok, ethically. Sort of."
118325	"The civil war tour is quite popular. But it seems our vehicles had a... malfunctioning. All those hours trapped in a steel box. Makes our guests talkative, I'm sure."
118326	"I've planned for a big anniversary event. That'll make our hotel a talking point. Means we gotta ramp up our staff with Androids."
118327	"Already made sure exclusive invitations find their way to our special guests. I've set up a menu that'll tickle their palates. Make sure we'll have enough food."
118328	"Didn't have all the super-rare meat foodstuff on my radar. I'm not into steak and wine or what it's called. But only the best for our guests. Fly the stuff in."
118329	"Wow, these people are really digging in. Keep them steaks coming or there'll be customer complaints. I just wonder, what's so great about meat?"
118330	"Let's get to the highlight - a buffet in zero gravity. Don't worry, we won't be paying those laundry bills. But we will be setting a trend, trust me."
118331	"Okay, our glamourized bouncing castle needs more juice than I thought. Having the high-society fall on their backsides would disturb their animated conversations."
109048	"What to do with this old ruin? Well, I have an idea. Of course, no 'satisfaction guaranteed or your money back'! And you'd have to invest a lot before it pays off!"
114925	You may keep all the profits for yourself. I'm totally fine with my role as silent observer.
115322	Reach Corporation Level of 15 to begin the second hotel expansion.
115323	Reach Corporation Level of 30 to begin the third hotel expansion.
120057	Create and supply the biggest tourist attraction in outer space.
108452	"Just one slip of the pen on the form and boom, the suppliers scatter your goods all over the place!"
108453	"Stiffin' ol' Nic on the bills! Bring those bums to me and you can have the... reminder fee."
108454	"Let's just say it's a... special bottle message, with contents very dear to me."
108617	"An early cargo drop! Thought we'd save some time and try a cheaper shipping method."
108462	"The supply firm let me down here. But I know you wouldn't let ol' Nic down!"
108463	"When they asked me about a good, reliable supplier who asks no questions... guess whom I recommended."
108466	"Mutinary! Thankless bunch! But I'm reasonable... Drag them here and we'll talk about raises. My way."
108467	"Has Big Five written all over it! But Nic always delivers! Or his good friends..."
108470	"Thought ol' Nic wouldn't see it coming! The cargo hold is full of... unstable substances. Let's spring the trap!"
108471	"Look, didn't mean no harm, when I told him you're behind the loss. But he seems... displeased."
108474	"So many ships lost to today's violence. Would be a waste, if their packages remained unplunder... err, undelivered."
108475	"Just threw my crates overboard! For some bad checks! Ah, good thing I got me some of those fancy tracking devices."
108456	"It's... it's practically mine. The paperwork is... is just a little behind. Collect it, it'll be fine."
108460	"Release is in a few weeks. But one of my customers is on pins and needles, know what I mean?"
108618	"There're things you just shouldn't steal. Someone's gonna learn that lesson today."
108464	"Sent those goods over and over. Confiscated every time. But with your label on them, maybe… just maybe…"
108465	"I know, the reek... It's... ugh, just make sure it's delivered. The receiver will get the message."
108468	"Why do those Union agents always target my ships. Got nothin' to hide... say, how discreet are you?"
108469	"Not stolen... found it! And found a customer for it! But it seems someone misses it really badly."
108472	"If she blows the whistle, I'd be forced to publish all my business relations. You wouldn't want that."
108473	"Bah, postage free delivery! Let's hope this new start-up isn't caught in a series of... unfortunate events."
121241	"So my clients decided to show up unannounced and in a bad mood. Think you can help getting their stuff to them?"
121243	"The Big Five have been getting awfully competitive lately... Let's intercept some deliveries, they'll be busy blaming each other."
108626	"Really, a trading partner! Came all the way out here! But err... can you pick them up while I prepare the documents?"
108627	"Oh no... seems I lost that shipment! But if I request a retrieval team everyone will know I screwed up!"
108628	"Express delivery. Said I didn't care where they drop off, as long as they do it quickly... well."
108629	"Man, of all things the raiders picked my freighter! The crew got out okay, but we gotta salvage what's left of the cargo."
108630	"Man, the Union cut the supplies for the Arctic Protection Fund again. Could you pitch in just this once?"
108631	"I need to get on this customer's good side. The how-to guides say stuff about free giveaways. Worth a try."
108632	"Oops, that transporter should've made it here. That's what the Custodians get for being so damn stingy about everything."
108633	"A distress signal! Yeah, it comes from a poacher ship. But, we can't just leave those people strained, right?"
108634	"I'm not a friend of violence, but the Custodian orders are. No raider ships allowed here. Say, could you..."
108635	"Yo, I'm not making that up! There's a whole fleet of them in this sector! And still, no one believes me!"
108636	"I'm supposed to check on a data cache for Dr. Meticulous, but I don't even know where to start!"
108637	"My fellow Custodians said it's way important. Only someone reliable like I could do it. But I need help."
108638	"Wanted to install some anti-theft trackers, but the raiders beat us to the punch. In all senses of the word."
108639	"A fellow roped me into testing his new detection system. Got loads to do, but how could I say no?"
108640	"Nah, only heard good things about this trader. He forgot to provide some info in the papers, but that can happen to anybody."
108641	"Having them owe us is definitely gonna pay off for the Custodians, and boy do we need that."
108642	"I told him not to go. Now a friend of mine is stuck in hostile waters. I'd appreciate if you kept this to yourself, 'kay?"
108643	"Yo, those polluters, they've directly run into our trap. Why won't the Big Five leave us in peace?"
108644	"Why isn't the Global Union doing anything about these pirate threats? Sometimes I wonder if they've forgotten about us."
108645	"No kiddin', fellow Custodians doing business with poachers! Know where they are, but you have to keep a low profile."
121244	"You got a minute? I'm kind of stressing out about these deliveries, I just can't figure out how to organize this!"
121245	"The poaching is getting out of hand! I just can't catch those bastards, they've got surveillance and keep switching locations."
108647	"One of our agents needs a get-away, stat. Can I trust you with her safety?"
108648	"My contacts dropped off some supplies. They couldn't risk sending the coordinates, but we've got the general area."
108649	"Had to abandon medicine supplies to get away from Orbital Watch hellhounds. But, I need those here, asap!"
108650	"I've discovered a great place to restock. Had nearby agents dig up LEC caches, but they still need to be picked up."
108651	"More refugees just arrived and we're missing basically everything. A small donation would be great."
108652	"My Orbital Watch contact must replace the shipment she has sent us or she's in deep shit. We're not letting her down, right?"
108654	"One of our rovers is acting up again. If you get it here somehow, we'll fix it on our own."
108655	"Damn, their life support systems! No time to lose! We have to get to this fugitive rover now!"
108656	"An intact, abandoned vehicle? There? Clearly a Orbital Watch trap, I'm not falling for."
108657	"I need a good diversion. It's still a risk, but for their route plans I'm willing to take it."
108658	"A lot of my trading goods come from abandoned First Wave facilities. We can't afford to be picky. Keep your eyes open!"
108659	"We're safe to collect the caches now. After I jammed the mine field Drake had put up there. Barbaric."
108660	"The Orbital Watch stumbled over one of my old hideouts. Get the stuff back before they realize what exactly they found."
108661	"Yeah, go ahead, grab more of that! Orbital Watch, taking from those who have nothing left."
108662	"Shit, surveillance drones! But my smugglers risked a lot to get here, we're not blowing this off now."
108663	"Good, the supply delivery made it here. But one thoughtless move and the Watch got us. Counting on you."
108664	"Our convoy drove right into an Orbital Watch trap. We're lucky no one was injured, so please make sure it stays that way."
